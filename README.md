My name is AJ.  I have been interested in computer programming for 15 years and am feeling great about learning and creating a portfolio.
I started learning some MS DOS when I was probably 14 or 15.  HTML at 17-18.  Then I took a long break and learned things on my own. After a few years of preparing myself with Code Academy and other programming websites, I commited to UMFK's Cyber Security Program. I am very excited about this.
